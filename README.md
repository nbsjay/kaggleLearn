# KaggleLearn
## Intro
As part of my data analytics study journey, I am taking short courses on Kaggle which are centered around data analysis and data science. 

## Courses
The courses I am taking include:
* intro to programming
* python
* pandas
* data cleaning
* data visualisation
* sql


## Files
The codes included in this repository are solutions to exercises and problems given throuhout the courses.
As such, the bulk of codes that are shown here are written in python(.py files) and sql.

To help me grasp/ remember certain concepts, I note down some important points and explantions in **notes**

I use **test.py** files to test code before I write them in a main file
